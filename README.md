# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This project is inspired by the book *Writing an Interpreter in Go* by Thorsten Ball. It serves as a hands-on exploration of how interpreters function under the hood. By following along with the book, I aim to deepen my understanding of interpreter design and implementation using the Go programming language.

## Objectives
- Learn the fundamental concepts of interpreters.
- Implement a fully functional interpreter in Go.
- Gain practical experience with Go's syntax and features.
- Be able to create an interpreter that can process the Monkey programming language.
